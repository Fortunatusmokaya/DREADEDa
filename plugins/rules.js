ðŸ’Ž *DREADED BOT RULES*

ðŸ¤– _Bot *MUST BE ADMIN* of groups added._

ðŸ’Ž _Its completely unnecessary to call a bot, rather you will be blocked._
    
ðŸ’Ž _Do not spam bot with commands, if bot is not responding then it means either bot is off or there's internet issue at owner's end._
    
ðŸ’Ž _Bot or its owner are not responsible for what the bot sends in terms of media._
    
ðŸ’Ž _Well, the bot has not been installed with ffmpeg package and probably may not send some image media!_
    
ðŸ’Ž _Usage of bot in ways that promote racism, slavery, pollution etc will lead to bot exiting the group or ban._

ðŸŒ€ _Bot ain't perfect and probably has some bugs, be patient and report them to owner!_
    
ðŸŽ‡ _Enjoy whatever the bot offers and break above rules, Issa free world_
   
 ðŸ’– _By Fortunne._
